AgriWatch: Real-Time Agricultural Monitoring with AI, IoT, and HPC

Overview

AgriWatch is an innovative project that leverages artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), and high-performance computing (HPC) to monitor agricultural conditions in real time. Designed to aid farmers, researchers, and government entities, AgriWatch focuses on detecting plant stress, particularly through ethylene levels, temperature, humidity, and VOC (volatile organic compound) data. The project aims to identify potential issues such as pathogen infections and environmental stressors early, enabling timely interventions to protect crop health and yield.

Features

Real-Time Monitoring: Continuous tracking of critical environmental factors like ethylene concentration, temperature, humidity, and VOCs.
AI-Driven Insights: Use of advanced machine learning models, including LSTM and transformers, to classify data as normal or stress-inducing conditions.
Simulated Sensor Data: Realistic synthetic data generation with controlled noise to simulate various agricultural scenarios.
Pathogen Detection: Early identification of plant pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi through AI analysis of sensor data.
Scalable and Customizable: Flexible enough to be used by individuals, small farmers, or large agricultural enterprises.
Project Goals

Optimize Crop Health: Provide actionable insights to prevent crop loss due to environmental stress or pathogens.
Support Sustainable Farming: Use data-driven decisions to minimize the use of chemicals and improve resource management.
Scalable Implementation: Develop AgriWatch into a product that offers services for individuals, companies, and governments, with tiered pricing models to make it accessible to a broad audience.
Data and Models

AgriWatch uses sensor data (real or simulated) to monitor the following parameters:

Ethylene: 0.1 – 1 µL/L (Normal), 1 – 5 µL/L (Abnormal)
Temperature: 18-25°C (Normal)
Humidity: 60-70% RH (Normal)
VOCs: 5-50 µg/m³ (Normal), 50-200 µg/m³ (Abnormal)
The AI models are trained on this data to classify conditions as either normal or indicative of stress, with a particular focus on early pathogen detection.

Getting Started
